### What is this repository for? ###
The repository concerns the paper "Extending Behavior Trees for Robotic Missions with Quality Requirements." It contains the domain-specific language (DSL) we developed using model-driven (MD) techniques in the paper.
We built the DSL on top of [BehaviorTree.CPP 4.6](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP). The meta-model provided can be seen as a meta-model for BehaviorTree.CPP with quality concerns. A high-resolution picture of our DSL's meta-model is provided [here](meta-model%20pictures).

### How do I set up the DSL? ###
